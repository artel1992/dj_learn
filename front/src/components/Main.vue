                    To the company, sustainability means creating value for all stakeholders on a lasting basis:
                    customers, employees, investors, business partners and the society as a whole. The basis for this is
                    the sustainable business strategy of Daimler in which the company takes responsibility for the
                    economic, ecological and social effects of its business activities and looks at the entire value
                    chain.
